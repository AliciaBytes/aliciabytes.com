Hey, I'm AliciaBytes. Here's how I protect your data and respect your privacy.

## Data I collect

If you are only a visitor to my website, please know that I do not collect any personal data. I also don't set any cookies or do any other logging.

The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) which saves access information that is required to provide the website to you and guarantee proper service.

The website also uses [Umami](https://umami.is/) for privacy friendly analytics to know what pages are being accessed on what devices/viewport sizes, so that I know what to focus on with development and web changes. It doesn't set any cookies or uses any personally identifiably data.

If you contact me directly through the linked contact email ([contact@aliciabytes.com](mailto:contact@aliciabytes.com)), I may receive additional information such as email address, your name, content of the message, and/or attachments you may send me, and any other information you choose to provide. I will delete this data at latest 3 months after our last communication, or immediately upon request.

## How I use your information

I use the information only with consent, for example when you send me an e-mail and expect a reply from me.
