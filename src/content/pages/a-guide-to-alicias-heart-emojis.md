excerpt: I'm gonna go and wear my heart on my sleeve here. I'm already always pretty open about myself. And I try to be open about intentions, although one can always do better. But that's not the topic here. The topic is my heart. Well, at least my heart emojis. I'm a very weird and quirky woman.

I'm gonna go and wear my heart on my sleeve here. I'm already always pretty open about myself. And I try to be open about intentions, although one can always do better. But that's not the topic here. The topic is my heart. Well, at least my heart emojis. I'm a very weird and quirky woman. I don't know how common it is for others, but I have a bunch of meanings for the different heart emojis and colors. And why not share that little quirky bit about me?

## General note

While my hearts have specific meanings you gotta be aware that things in life always depend. There will always be exceptions where I use a heart in a different way than I use it in other general cases. Emotions can fluctuate and change, and I won't limit myself to following a reference. This is just a general lay of the land kind of thing what each one means most of the time. Also the meanings of my hearts have shifted quite a bit over the last few years and continue to be in constant motion. I can't guarantee that this guide here will always reflect my newest feelings regarding specific hearts.

And sometimes I completely disregard my general feelings for a specific heart emoji and use a specific fixed one for a person because I know it's their favorite emoji version or their favorite color. For example each one of my partners also has their individual heart color that I use for them and the general meaning I use that color for doesn't apply anymore.

## Fancy hearts

Those hearts are really special. I tend to use them a lot for special occasions. I also use them sometimes if I'm feeling good and lucky and really happy in general or something in my life is currently special, but that's not their main use.

- Growing heart üíó: So this one is the ultimate heart for me. I love you a lot and you mean the world to me. I'm falling more and more in love with you. Or my emotions are growing towards you. Sometimes in a just platonic way it's used to show that I'm growing closer to you and feeling the relationship deepen. On very happy days I might even use that one more casually towards people I like or show that I absolutely loved the time together.
- Revolving hearts üíû: Usually they mean I'm sending you lots of love. Lots of support. Wish I could support you, help you, hug you, be there for you right now. I want to send you immediate love to make you feel better. Just I care about you a lot. Not necessarily coupled with love or special feelings, just wanting to send support/love/positivity.
- Beating heart üíì: You're definitely doing something right. I'm excited, enjoying it and loving whatever we have. Again not specifically coupled with special feelings towards you, but things are really positive. *Excited happy heart noises!*
- Two hearts üíï: Usually just to show that I'm feeling a connection. I don't think I use that one a lot? Do I? Maybe I should really use it more, because right now thinking about it, it feels like I'm underutilizing it.

## Colored hearts

Those are the main hearts that show different feelings and levels of emotions. I use them a lot. I love to show hearts and send them to people. I'm just very open with my hearts. And even if they might mean quite a bit, it might not be a reason to overthink right away.

- Purple heart üíú: Purple is my favorite color. I love this a lot. And maybe I want to get there with you too? Just maybe. I usually use this for people I'm really close too and people I really like, or am crushing on. Also for special occasions or sending really a lot of support.
- Green heart üíö: Green is the color of hope. I usually use this one to send and show support. When I want to be there for others. But it also gets used for good friends or people I'd like to get to know more and maybe become good friends with. Definitely into your vibe! :3
- Blue heart üíô: People I'm not really close with. Someone I'd love to hang out and become more of a friend with. Not as strong as the green one, but still I like your vibe and maybe we can do something together. 
- Orange heart üß°: Casual friends/acquaintances. You're a good bean and I like you, but probably I don't know you enough yet to up you further? Or something else maybe I guess?
- Yellow heart üíõ:  Highly situation dependent. I might use it for various reasons not listed here. But often it's just a casual heart. An "I don't know you, but I like this" heart.
- Black heart üñ§: The "Enigma heart". I use it for situations where I don't know exactly. Or it might be that you are an enigma to me at the moment still. Maybe I don't know how I feel about things. Or I'm feeling a bit dark right now in general. It's often just an unknown random enigma heart and I often don't know the reason why I use it myself.
- White heart ü§ç: It's a blank heart. For when I can't decide what heart to use. Don't interpret too much into it, it could be used for all kinds of reasons. Sorry to not be able to tell you more about it or my feelings when using it. Chances are there's not really any deeper meaning behind it!
- Gray heart ü©∂: I don't use this one often at all? I don't know what to tell you. It's not in my standard use and there's probably some meaning? Maybe? I don't know? Chances are you won't see this one (a lot).

## Thoughts for the end

I just wanna say that this is kind of nice to share. Being open about emotions or how I sometimes share them with others. Again, don't take this as a strict reference sheet, emotions are weird and quirky. And I'm already quirky enough without focusing on emotions specifically. I'm a bit curious now though if anyone else has special meanings behind their hearts? Or do you have one favorite heart color that you tend to use for almost anything? Really all hearts and emotions are valid and special, but it would be interesting to know how people tick there.
