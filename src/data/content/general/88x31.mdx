# Add my 88x31 button to your website

I created an 88x31 button because I like the idea. So if you'd like it to your website, here's how to ğŸ¥ºğŸ‘‰ğŸ‘ˆğŸ©µ:

Static version:


```html
<a href="https://www.aliciabytes.com">
    <img
    width="88px"
    height="31px"
    src="https://www.aliciabytes.com/88x31.webp"
    alt="A 88x31 button with the text 'AliciaBytes' at the bottom. At the top there is a rainbow unicorn/caticorn horn that becomes smaller towards the top right where it tip ends pointing towards the corner."
    />
</a>
```

Preview:

<a href="https://www.aliciabytes.com">
    <img
    width="88px"
    height="31px"
    src="/88x31.webp"
    alt="A 88x31 button with the text 'AliciaBytes' at the bottom. At the top there is a rainbow unicorn/caticorn horn that becomes smaller towards the top right where it tip ends pointing towards the corner."
    decoding="async"
    fetchpriority="low"
    loading="lazy"
    />
</a>

Animated version:

```html
<a href="https://www.aliciabytes.com">
    <img
    width="88px"
    height="31px"
    src="https://www.aliciabytes.com/88x31-animated.webp"
    alt="A 88x31 button with the text 'AliciaBytes' at the bottom. At the top there is a rainbow unicorn/caticorn horn that becomes smaller towards the top right where it tip ends pointing towards the corner. The rainbow horn is animated slowly adding more and more of its rainbow segments until they all disappear at the end again."
    />
</a>
```
