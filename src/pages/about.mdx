# Hi, I'm Alicia.

Taking my own weird way through life with lots of sticks, and stones in the way. Life doesn't have to be straightforward, so I'm just taking my own weird way and living it to the fullest now. I'm mostly gonna be writing about my journey through the tech industry and my learnings along the way, but might also write about life in general and private topics every now and then.
