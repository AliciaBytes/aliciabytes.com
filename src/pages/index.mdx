# Hi, I'm Alicia.

I'm a queer, dorky nerd from Switzerland who loves tech way too much. I work as a software developer and enjoy tinkering around in my free time as well. Taking my own weird way through life with lots of sticks, and stones in the way. But that won't stop me. Life doesn't have to be straightforward, so I'm just taking my own weird way and living it to the fullest now. I'm mostly gonna be writing about my journey through the tech industry and my learnings along the way, but might also write about life in general and private topics every now and then.

If you want to follow me, I have a bunch of (social) links down below in the footer.
