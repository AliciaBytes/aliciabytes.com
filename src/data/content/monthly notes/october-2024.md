## Quick bits

- I started a new job, and so far it's been going great. I'm enjoying it a lot. The usual onboarding phase with it's issues that you always have at the start, but otherwise seems to be going well.
- I've been getting started with learning French. So far it's going really slow and expect myself to be absolute useless beginner level for quite a while. I got some help from a cutie, but it also means that my French so far has been very gay driven and focused ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜‡
- Making others teach you and then using it for evil is a lot of fun. Je suis une gobelin poubelle! ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
- I've been thinking of switching to [Anytype](https://anytype.io) from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for organizing all kind of life things. This will probably be a big move of all my notes/organization so I would really like feedback ([on fedi](https://tech.lgbt/@AliciaBytes/113411966649242495) or elsewhere) and experiences from others if possible before I make the move.
- Why are there so many cuties and why are they all so far away??? I want to meet more of them, but my time is very limited, which makes this very frustrating ðŸ˜¥

## What happened this month

I've realized that I've been in Switzerland for over half a year now? I guess I'm starting to properly acclimate. It was a big change because I went from 100% remote job to hybrid job again with a longer stretch that was fully in office, so the commutes cut in a lot. Especially in combination with the longer weekly work hours. But my body slowly adjusted now.

I also tried (and am still trying) to actively put myself out there, connect and make friends. Especially locally. So far it's going pretty mixed. I've made quite a few new friends. Sadly most of them quite far away. ðŸ˜… Some of them are local though. So it's going slow but steady I guess. And maybe some of the people who are not local yet will be at least a bit more local in the future.

Gosh, language learning is so much more fun if you can actually use it. Especially for evil. I hated the stupid learning aproach at school where you just get a ton of grammar and vocabulary thrown at you without actual immersion and usage. I think living in Switzerland with it's multiple languages and general diversitiy of language and accents will be very helpful for me in the long term in that regard. Currently I'm still too unexperienced to really hold most conversations unless you want me to say gay shit.

The flights for the Australia vacation next year is booked. It's a long vacation to make the long flight worth it, and I'm really excited already. It's my first time leaving Europe and my longest flight by far! Usually I prefer to go to places by train, but you know... Australia is kind of hard to reach in that way ðŸ˜…

## Entertainment

- I've been playing a lot of Monster Hunter: Worlds and having a lot of fun. If you also enjoy the game and want to join in (I'm still grinding up through the game) you should contact me and add me on Steam.
- Started watching [Lost Girl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1429449/) with one of my partners.
- Been liking some Swiss German songs recently. I like the language, the dialects, how diverse and authentic it makes people feel. Just the little uniqueness of language is already a nice thing.
