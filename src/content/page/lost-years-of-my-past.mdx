So my past is very non-linear and I've been debating shedding light on it publicly for a few months now. Especially the last few weeks it kept coming up. This isn't something I usually put out there, because I know it's a lot and I don't want to dump it onto people. But I don't want to hide it either, I'm open about it when it comes up. It's a part of me, part of my life, and as such it has influenced me and changed the way I am, like every life experience does. <span style="color: var(--color-rosewater);">**Since some of the topics might be heavier I'll put them behind localized "spoiler" blocks with specific content warnings relevant to them, as well as inline spoilers that can be hovered over (clicked on mobile) to reveal them. I'll try to do a good job and I hope it'll also be readable without them though.**</span> And also due to that heavy nature I'm still gonna restrict it, leave out some parts, summarize, and not go into full detail, etc. If you would like to know/talk more about parts of it (and we know each other, you're currently going through or have gone through something similar in your life, etc.), feel free to reach out to me privately, I'm open about my past. And thankfully it's all in the past now and my life is infinitely better.

This doesn't actually have anything bad, but just so you know how spoilers are gonna look like

Disclaimer: I tried to blend out certain parts of my past during times of my life, so some things are a bit of a blur.

## So what's it about my past now anyways?

It's a mix of lot of things that added up and created a bumpy non-linear path that took a lot of time and work to get out of. Close to 9 years with breaks of things going smoothly here and there. Some of it includes **childhood trauma, depression, family issues, bullying, struggles with being queer (trans, bisexual)**.

## At home

I grew up with my mom as a single parent, but surrounded by a lot of my extended family from her side. I really enjoyed that part of childhood all the way through the first grade of elementary school. Sadly it didn't stay that way for long. During summer break I got a new stepdad and we moved in with him, with me not knowing him at all beforehand and being very cautious around him. He tried to make a good impression the first few months I guess, but that didn't last too long. **CW: Manipulation** <InlineSpoiler>Soon enough, he'd start trying to shape me and manipulate me into his son, the boy he thought I should be. He already knew what I should like and what I shouldn't like. What I should be like.</InlineSpoiler> And I was definitely too girly and feminine for him. He'd of course keep up the appearance. For example also introducing father son days that looked on the outside like he was trying to be a good dad and me just making it hard for him. But those days weren't about spending time together, they were about having me with him, <InlineSpoiler>so he can make me be the way he wanted to. I didn't have a say in what we did, they were his days. We did what he wanted and I had to behave the way he wanted if I didn't want issues.</InlineSpoiler> Of course that didn't happen from one day to the other. It gradually increased. One big point of increase and problems was when he learned how I used to play with the puppets of my cousin. That of course didn't fit into the picture of "his boy" at all, I wasn't supposed to be like that, that was something for girls only! At least in his mind... And he made sure I knew about that. I got restrictions on girly stuff, like not being allowed to watch shows that were deemed too girly by him, etc. What didn't help at all was that he was at home way more than my mom due to the nature of their work. He was always around and watching. Also since we moved in with him the rest of my family was also far away for me as a child and I didn't really have a place to go to and talk about this.

That came to a big climax when I was 10 years old when he found out I wanted to be a girl. We had a fight after I watched something to girly. And I mad the (back then) horrible mistake of telling him that I wish I was a girl anyways. I already liked the way girls were and wanted to be one of them for quite a while back then, but didn't know anything about being trans or have any word foor it. He absolutely hated it, that's not how I was supposed to be.

<Spoiler>
<summary slot="summary">His reaction, CW: transphobia, childhood trauma, threats</summary>
He made sure I knew I wasn't supposed to be like this. That this wasn't right. And that I'd never be accepted like that. Among other things he told me: "You're a freak and failure, you're not a real boy and you'll never be. You'll never have real friends or someone who'd love you. Even my family and mom would never love me if they knew how I was and he'd rather get rid of me and not have me around, but they have to live with me since I'm a child and the others don't know. And I better make sure nobody ever learns about how I am."

A nice thing to hear from your stepdad as a 10 year old, isn't it? And well, he'd make sure nobody learnt about me being like this. By being abusive. By watching more and threatening me. Making me feel guilty and awful for how I was, who I was.
</Spoiler>

As a follow up to make sure nobody would learn about it, he'd start hovering around even more, watching me even more. I couldn't really be around friends too much or take them home with me because of how he was. Of course that wasn't good for me, it influenced my mental health which was a good excuse for him to do it more openly, since of course the mental health issue was due to bullying and they needed to watch and protect me.

At some point when I was 14 we had my cousins over during school holidays. I tried to not show anything in front of them because I was scared. But still, somehow one of my cousins picked up on something being off. Apparently afterwards when they were back home he went crying to my grandma and told her that something was wrong with me, things weren't good for me there. And she called my mom and told her. That's why a few days later instead of driving to work my mom drove somewhere else, waited until she was sure my stepdad was gone for work too, and then returned. We immediately packed the essentials, what we absolutely needed and could fit in the car with us. Then we left for my grandparents. I was relieved about it. It felt good being away. But the day turned much more dramatic and scary when my "stepdad" came home from work and figured out what happened. He came after us and wanted to get us back. I was terrified for a while, but thankfully we were safe with the rest of my family. That said, everything from back then definitely left marks on my mental health. And a bit more of it came up with the divorce between my mom and my stepdad later.

## At school

Meanwhile at school I've slowly become a bit of an outsider. I couldn't come over to people too much, couldn't invite them to come over to my place, couldn't even talk too much about things at home because of the situation. I was scared to say the wrong thing with my stepdad. His plan had worked. I felt more and more isolated. People also thought I was weird with how I never opened up about private things or avoided talking about home.

The puberty mad things way worse. It's a complicated time for many children but for me it became especially hard. There was a fight between hating all the oncoming changes to my body, they felt absolutely wrong. Hiding any bit of feminity because of what my stepdad had told me, and because I internalized at that point that **CW: internalized transphobia** <InlineSpoiler>it was my fault, may failure, that I was a freak and couldn't let others know about it</InlineSpoiler>. I apparently did an awful job at hiding feminity though, as there was rumors about me being gay, which led to homophobia and all kinds of bullying from other pupils. Sports lessons and of course swimming lessons were the worst, I hated the changing rooms, I hated my body, it made me sick. The way I was made me sick with self hatred and I couldn't accept it.

<Spoiler>
<summary slot="summary">The fight to accepting who I was. Internalized trauma due to stepdad's reaction.</summary>
I struggled a lot to accept myself. I struggled fighting to not feal like a freak that wasn't supposed to be. The self fulfilling isolation at school because I didn't feel like I could talk about things at home, couldn't take others home with me or go to there place a lot made the words from my stepdad that I'll never have real friends or someone who'd love me feel like they were real. It was a self fulfilling rhythm. The more I hated myself for it, the more I tried to avoid others and not be there. The more I became isolated and bullied. The more his words seemed true again. The self hatred and isolation festered and ate me up.

The bullying and hate made it feel really long. I hated breaks when we were unsupervised because that's when bullying was worst, and was glad when classes were in session. School was a very very long time.
</Spoiler>

I left the Gymnasium and went down to Realschule for mental health reasons too, because everything got too much. Sadly the one thing I always fled to was fantasy (mostly books), I devoured a lot of books and imagined myself in a different world without all those issues. As a woman... and everythign was fine there. I also started teaching myself to program. Thankfully that wasn't the worst way to cope and escape from the situation, I never took drugs, never smoked, only had a glass of wine here and there when going out like normal young adults, although I don't even drink any alcohol nowadays.😅 Despite all those things I'm happy about this.

## After school

Sadly thigns didn't go smoothly after school either. I was already sure I wanted to do software development for work. I learnt programming on the side in my free time and really enjoyed it. It was one of the things I could really sink into and focus on and I just forgot a lot of the other things around me. Sadly we had a career coach over at school and they made clear that nobody would want someone from Realschule as software developer. You'd need to be really smart and study at the very least. Now I know this is total fucking bullshit, but back then I was impressionable with how I was, lookign for my way forward out of all those things. So I tried to go further in school, but the general mental health issues, the bullying and trauma related to school didn't make that easy. So it was bumpy off and on and I mostly gave it up for the time being.

## Mental health, the medical side and getting out of it

It was a long road to get my mental health in order. Already during school I started with outpatient mental health treatment. And later on I was at a youth mental health ward for quite a few months due to it. Whith the time at the youth mental health ward also leading me to repeat the final year in Realschule since I simply missed too much of it. I was prescribed some medication to help with the depression and also with trouble sleeping due to the thoughts. After the youth mental health ward things went better for a while, I even could stop outpatient care for it for a while. Sadly after some time it fell back with the struggles trying to figure out my future. The path I wanted being blocked by formal educational requirements that seemed down a path of trauma. I fell back and later was at the adult mental health ward for a few days.

My mom also threw me out at some point then because she couldn't handle my depression anymore. Thankfully I had my grandparents that took me in. I kept struggling there trying to improve the school situation. I was in outpatient mental health care again and for a long time. I went to solo and group therapy. I also was at a re-socialzing work place for a while to get my normal rhythm back. But all of that didn't really help me much. It just reduced the symptoms but didn't deal with the underlying issues, my struggle with myself, my self-hatred, me fighting to accept myself. That's what really needed to disappear to get my life back to normal. Thankfully things changed later.

## Finding community as a trans person

But things only really got better when I found connection to the online trans community through social media. When I connected with people there, found people there who were happy just living their life. At that point I still felt very much like a freak and that I couldn't be who I was, but they slowly opened the world for me. As I started writing with some people in the trans community, I slowly started to realize I could be a woman and things would be fine. The internalized hatred, transphobia, everything that was fed to me was a lie. I could live life the way I am and be happy. I got my first dress and hid it, wearing it occasionally in my room. I got more serious with programming and prepared for job search, and then finally looked for an apprenticeship spot. I explicitly looked for something in a big city, and with some distance from home to have some distance to the past while going through things and trying to find myself. Trying to be myself. I was able to stop all the medication I had for depression a while before moving away for my apprenticeship. The hope gave me so much strength and made me feel so much better.

I came out to my family, and moved away for my apprenticeship even before it had started (thanks to not going out much and saving a lot I could aford living alone for a few months before the actual apprenticeship started). Tbh I was terrified at that point too, there was fear inside of me. I'd just finally started on the work path and I was gonna transition? What if that screws up everything and I fuck up my one chance at a career working, what would that mean for getting my life finally in order? 😨😰😱😱😱 Thankfully, the apprenticeshop turned out amazing. I got really lucky with the company. Transitioning took a lot of time and work too. Experimenting with how I dress and going out more feminine, feeling more comfortable in more and more different clothes that unlike my past clothings, I actually liked. Finally being able to start hormones and the medical transition after a while. The name change with the court case and psychological assessments was a pain too, I hope things in Germany improve and get easier for future trans people. And of course, getting my life in general in order at the same time. More of a social life, friendships. So much changed for me over thos years, it was like night and day. It was an amazing metamorphosis. 🥺🤩

But despite all the changes and everything going on, it all finally just felt normal. I was just living my life, being the way I was. Normal plain old nerdy Alicia with all my normal interests, reading books, playing TTRPGs, etc. The way things should have always just been. Nothing special.

With me transitioning I also felt like my relationship with my mom (which was quite rocky after she threw me out, as you can imagine) slowly got better. It felt like she realized what went on with me in the past, what I went through and started understanding me more. Transitioning did so much for me, I just couldn't live as the person I was before, it was just trying to live a lie. Now I could finally be me. And I was very happy. My mental health and mood constantly improved.

## The Now. Being in a happy stable place in life.

Jump forward to now. I'm basically done with my transition, now it's just upkeep and living my life as the person I am. I found a community, people who I grew really close to and care about. I found love!!! I am happy. Life is amazing and only getting better all the time. It's amazing how much just being yourself can do for you. So now it's just all about continuing to live my life. Spend more time with the people I care about. Getting closer to and being able to spend more time with my love, living life together. Having stability going forward. And hopefully also giving back. I want to support the people who are close to me, be there for them and give them someone to hold onto. And in the future I would love to maybe give back to people who are struggling with themselves, their identity too. Maybe even volunteer. Hell, I even already looked into somewhere I'd love to volunteer and help out in the future. Life can be amazing and I want others to also be able have that. Lifting some weights off others.

In the end we all have struggles in our life. Some more visible, others more hidden. Some lighter, others heavier. And waters can be deep without people knowing what's actually going on in the depths. Let's make life easier for everyone.
