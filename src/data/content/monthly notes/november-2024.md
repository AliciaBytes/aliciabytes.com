## Quick bits

- Lots of complicated feelings this month, it was very emotional internally. 😕😵‍💫
- Some good things got set into motion, but sadly it actually happening is still quite a while away. But it's moving slowly. And not something I can further specify yet.
- Still feeling way behind of where I should be in life. Where I want to be in life. And that it's hard/impossible to catch up. I am working on it... Just doesn't feel like I'm really progressing much, if at all. 😣
- Also I'm a bit early, but I already figured out my new year's resolutions a bit early.  Also long term goals. Let's see how well I can get through them this time. It's not like I set so many goals that I'm completely overwhelmed sometimes... 😕
- I decided not to move my notes to [Anytype](https://anytype.io) after all. While trying it out I found some bigger issues to my workflow. So I'll stay with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for now.
- My French learning has fallen a bit to the wayside. But I'll get back to that again once things calm down a bit...
- I think I need things to calm down. And a break.

## What happened this month

What happened this month? Honestly, a lot. And also a big part of it is just a blur now! So much things happening, so little time to rest in-between. I really felt like I was constantly racing from one thing to the next and barely had time to breathe and recover. And yeah, because it was such a race from one to the next I kind of forgot most and can't write that much here... 😅 Sadly the end of year time is also like always filled with a ton of plans and it's not getting easier yet.

On the positive the new job has been going quite well and I like it. I also got to know and interact a bit more with people outside of my team which was good. I hope it keeps getting even more amazing. 😊

We've also been keeping up with organizing a lot of Raclette dinners and inviting others over which has been really nice. Although it's also hard to schedule now. 😔
And I learnt about a few nice places I could go to get to know more people locally. 😊

Oh, also I had a big reason to overhaul my heart page this month. Love is something amazing. 🥺👉👈💗

## Entertainment

- Rewatched John Wick again, I enjoy those movies.
- Started playing Elite Dangerous and I'm trying hard to build up things and not be a total noob anymore, but that game has a big learning curve and a lot of things it doesn't tell you to start off. Also it doesn't run well on my laptop, sadly. ✨💫

A bigger thing was being at a LAN party with my GF 💙. It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it, we played a lot of games together. Trackmania, Unrailed, Elite Dangerous (yes, this is where that started). The only negative thing was the first night. We were gonna sleep at the venue. My GF has a good camping mat, I don't so I took her really old and bad one and I felt like I slept directly on the hard concrete floor and everything hurt in the morning. So I did the sensible thing: I immediately bought a nice new mattress for 2 people and 2 new comfy sleeping bags since we only had one and used that opened up as a kind of blanket but it wasn't good either. The 2 sleeping bags can also be linked together to 1 big one for comfy snuggles at night. The mattress and combined sleeping bag are made with 2 people in mind, but we could comfortably fit 3 in there even for future snuggles. That all in combination with some necessary tech purchases and things reaching their end of life / falling apart meant some spendings I didn't plan on beforehand, but meh...
