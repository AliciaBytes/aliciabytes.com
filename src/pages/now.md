# What I'm currently up to

I want to use this page as a small space to share what I'm generally up to in life without going into too many details or talking about anything sensitive/private. Maybe somebody else will find something here that they'll get curious about and want to try doing themselves, find shared hobbies to talk with and a reason to reach out to me or whatever honestly. I'm gonna try to keep this page updated, but please cut me some slack, life just sometimes happens. And sometimes it tends to happen way too hard/fast.

## Getting settled in Switzerland

I recently moved in with one of my partners in Switzerland and am getting settled. There was sadly way more bureaucracy/issues involved with the process than I would have liked due to external factors. One can only plan that much... but in the end you sometimes still have to rely on external things and if they don't work it makes things complicated and it's not something you can always control.

## Getting back into personal projects

Yes, finally. Getting back into personal projects. Most stuff is still in the planning stage, but so far I'm doing:

- Working a bit more on this website, trying to really really slowly get it into a more decent state.
- Working through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) finally as a project to get deeper into C#. I've been planning on doing this for a while now.

## Entertainment

- Listening to the newest season of the [Dice Will Roll](https://www.dicewillroll.com) podcast as the episodes come out. This is the first time I'm following along as things get released and it's nice to chat with people in the community about it. It's also already brought me a lot of joy, entertainment and distraction when I wasn't doing well at all.
- Recently watched "Nimona" and really enjoyed it. Also some crying involved. But it's just a movie that fits my chaos goblin nature.
- Started a rewatch of all of Stargate SG-1

## Reading

A lot, honestly. But nothing specific. I have a big backlog of stuff I threw into a read later pile at some point, mostly blog posts, and I'm slowly crawling through them. I also have a bunch of books that I want to read, but I'll get to them when I crawled through the "shorter" pile of blogs first...
