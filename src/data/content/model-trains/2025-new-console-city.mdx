# 2025 New Console City Model Train Layout Growth

<Information>
For everyone's information, this is the layout of my girlfriend LinaBlue ([Fedi](https://ice.polycule.li/@LinaBlue)) that she also posted to a forum beforehand: [JNS*Forum](https://jnsforum.com/community/topic/21461-new-console-city-2025-version/). I'm just posting it here because I love it and enjoy her having fun with model trains and the big set up in our apartment. And because it's amazing and should be seen by more people. But yeah, all the credits for this post go to her, she did it ðŸ’œðŸ’™ðŸ’œ
</Information>

Sorry I have been a little absent. But after the big Console City at the end of 2021, which was more of a model train farewell party before I moved out of the huge apartment into a tiny one, with all my stuff. Games, things and trains in all kinds of shapes, sizes and scales. Got rid of stuff, got some new stuff. Changed my life around. The usual.

## New Place with Space

But I moved again last February. In a more spacious space. And we all know what this space shall be used for! (Foreshadowing)

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/empty-room.jpg" caption="A pretty empty apartment with a big window front that shows trees on the outside. Inside the room one can see a wagon with an Xbox fridge on it in the middle; a clothing rack, some lego constructions and boxes towards the left edge; a router on the right side." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

Some of you may already seen a glimpse of the latest change in the what did you do today thread. But first, how did I get there.
As you can see, this is just shortly after we got the keys for the new flat. All the space still available.

When I measured the window front, I was positively surprised. Over 9m in length.
And we all know what huge spacious spaces are used for? Storage! All the stuff I and my GF have, has to be stored somewhere, right? Sorry... no model train layout for now.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/room-full-of-moving-items.jpg" caption="The same room as above, but now items from the move are all over the place and one can mostly see an empty table on the left, the clothing rack now with clothing drying on it still in the middle, as well as some arcade machines around it, and a lot of the main space is now taken up with (still empty) Ikea shelves and storage units." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

But I was quick and most of all: motivated to clear everything away. That took some hours. But already on the first weekend, there was progress. We had our stuff moved in on a Tuesday, most track was laid on Sunday. Operations with friends on the weekend after. But more on that later. Priorities, right?

## Starting to Set Up

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/starting-setup-1.jpg" caption="A picture of the corner of the apartment with 8 small ikea tables and 2 double track lines. One of the double track lines goes into a 4 track station without any buildings around yet, but a trains standing on it, but nothing to the right yet." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

This time around I decided that I want to have 11 car long commuter trains, like the E235, E231 and E217 featured on Yamanote and Yokosuka Lines. Didn't do any prior planning, just took a train, rails, measured it out and put track down to see what fits.
What I did plan was a little freight yard for tank cars next to a simple stop.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/starting-setup-2.jpg" caption="Showing the same area as before, but further towards the right extending with more tables. One can see the old preliminary station without any train on it now. The second double track leads on though to a preliminary 2 track station. Behind it there is another 2 track station, with 1 track being higher up with tracks going up, it only leeds off to a single track line though. The 2 preliminary stations connect and there's a short shunting spot for a train." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

So a little mock-up of how it would look during operations.

Because of the scale of this layout, it'll be hard to show everything at once. But here a glimpse at the future track layout.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/starting-overview-1.jpg" caption="An overview shot (from the right) of the tables and model train layout extending along the window front with several sections going a bit further into the room. There are 2 loops now with 1 of the loops going over another track. One can see a lot of items from the move still standing around." width="1125" height="2000" quality="mid" />
<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/starting-overview-2.jpg" caption="Another shot of the layout focusing on the loop crossing over another track." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />
<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/starting-overview-3.jpg" caption="An overview shot from the left showing the right most loop, as well as a lot of little tracks going off for the preliminary stations." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

First, I just lay out all the track, turnouts, viaduct track etc. And only put in pillars later. To see first if the geometry holds up and if it actually fits in the space.
Some places where a tight fit, but so far, it ought to work.

## Finally: Trains Running

Putting in all the pillars, connectors and viaduct station parts is always such a pain, but not as much as cabling. Drawing all those power and turnout wires under the table stretch the patience of anyone. But soon, the first train was running!

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/trains-running-1.jpg" caption="A train towing a lot of fuel tanks over a railway bridge." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

That pillar got a more sturdy foundation shortly after this picture was taken. No worries!

After everything was deemed mostly working. Some greeble needed to get put on. Platforms, catenary and even a building or two got added swiftly after.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/trains-running-2.jpg" caption="An overview shot of a now quite improved layout. The first station areas have been put up with roofed platforms on 1 of the ground stations as well as one of the higher up stations on a platform/hill base." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />
<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/trains-running-3.jpg" caption="Shot of a station with 9 tracks/platforms whtat are partially roofed, as well as station buildings and stairs between them at the end." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />
<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/trains-running-4.jpg" caption="An overview shot of the right side of the layout. One can prominently see a Kirby plushie in the front looking into the camera. There's also a Bob-omb plushie in the rightmost loop as well as a few Gundams. There's 2 more train stations visible here, 1 roofed station with 2 tracks, another unroofed 2 track station, as well as 3 little shunting tracks that end really soon. There's also a higher up area on platforms with a 4 track completely roofed station, but the tracks are only really connected in the layout to the right, the left side still ends into nothing." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

Not perfect (yet) but already a lot of fun to operate alone or with friends.
As you may have noticed, the bridge after the viaduct station abruptly stops after a short length. The governing office did not yet acquire all building permissions and land usage permits. It is still fun to have some locos and short trains parked there. Also the layout is already pretty big, isn't it?

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/trains-running-5.jpg" caption="A shot of the left back corner of the setup where a single track with a bridge extends over a gap to another set of tables. Some further extensions here?" width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

Didn't stop us from adding a little single line extension at the other end. That one station had to be slightly remodelled (completely) to accommodate the new line parting off.
A friend helped me with installing the platform door on the long island platform for all the full commuter trains.

# The Consoles

But isn't this Console City, I hear someone of you ask. They got added, including some normal buildings I got in a Japan N Scale collection.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/the-consoles.jpg" caption="The central area of the layout still with the big Kirby plushie, but now there's a Playstation 3 as well as 3 Playstation 2's prominently in the front. And the back has a lot of high-rise buildings." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

The Playstations still look amazing as skyscrapers, don't they? Especially now that I have a lot more regular buildings to put beside them.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/the-silos.jpg" caption="3 tracks full of fuel tanks assumably being pulled by engines to the right. in the back there are several small and large cola cans as well as red bull cans functioning as silos/tanks." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

Also, my TAKI are used to ship caffeine instead of gasoline. ^^::
It would take around 18 of them to fill a can of cola.

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/2025-new-console-city/overview.jpg" caption="A wider overview shot of the room showing the set-up, as well as the room now being way cleaner. All the previous stuff that filled it from the move has already been partially put away. There's a carpet in front of the model train layout, the table now has items on it and there's a little storage cupboard on small wheels with the Kato train book cases and a progress pride flag hanging down over it." width="2000" height="1125" quality="mid" />

Getting an overview shot is difficult. But here, have an attempt at everything.
A fun little city to have trains running between consoles, around mechas and from station to station. With like 4 Stations and another 2 stops in between.

And there is still place to live. right?

That's not even close to the current layout, that's when we moved in and Lina began setting up everything. Currently it's already way bigger, and that will also eventually be shared with pictures. People on Fedi probably already have seen newer pictures than here.
