# What I'm currently up to

I want to use this page as a small space to share what I'm generally up to in life without going into too many details or talking about anything sensitive/private. Maybe somebody else will find something here that they'll get curious about and want to try doing themselves, find shared hobbies to talk with and a reason to reach out to me or whatever honestly. I'm gonna try to keep this page updated, but please cut me some slack, life just sometimes happens. And sometimes it tends to happen way too hard/fast.

## Baking & Cooking

I'm enjoying cooking and baking a lot recently. Never really got into baking before. But I think baking for my partners has now become a love language for me. One of my favorite cakes is [cheesecake with mandarins](/cheesecake-with-mandarins).

## Getting back into personal projects

Yes, finally. Getting back into personal projects. Most stuff is still in the planning stage, but so far I'm doing:

- Working a bit more on this website, trying to really really slowly get it into a more decent state. I actually set a goal to write 1-2 new posts per month.
- I started [streaming again](https://www.twitch.tv/aliciabytes). I want to do at least 1-2 streams per week. It's mostly a self improvement goal to be more comfortable about chatting with complete strangers in whatever situation. Hopefully becoming less shy through it.
- Some homelab / infrastructure topics. We recently set up a NAS and are now consolidating all our files and nicely filling things up. I'm also working on setting up more services for us. ☺️
- Some (maybe only for now) private projects.

## Entertainment

- Listening to the newest season of the [Dice Will Roll](https://www.dicewillroll.com) podcast together with my sister as the episodes come out. This is the first time I'm following along as things get released and it's nice to chat with people in the community about it. It's also already brought me a lot of joy, entertainment and distraction when I wasn't doing well at all.
- Still rewatching all of Stargate SG-1 as well as Ducktales.

## Reading

A lot, honestly. But nothing specific. I have a big backlog of stuff I threw into a read later pile at some point, mostly blog posts, and I'm slowly crawling through them. I also have a bunch of books that I want to read, but I'll get to them when I crawled through the "shorter" pile of blogs first...
