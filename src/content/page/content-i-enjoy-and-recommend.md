I want to share some of the things I enjoy. For the start it will be pretty limited and will grow as time goes on. In general I'm a nerd who loves anything techy, TTRPG, or video game related. I also try to do sports and have several that I enjoy although I'm just getting more into it from a longer break.

## Podcasts

- **[Dice Will Roll](https://www.dicewillroll.com/)**: They describe themselves as "The Queerest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet" and I really love their chaotic energy, the way they go through the official Pathfinder 2e adventures. They play a wide range of characters from lovely or dorky all the way to pure chaos energy with lots of roleplaying and interacting with NPCs. The adventures they did so far:
  - **Kingmaker**: Their first adventure which they started after the Pathfinder 2e playtest but before the official rules were released with their own port of the iconic Kingmaker adventure to 2nd Edition Pathfinder. Because of just starting out their whole podcasting set-up wasn't as good yet and you can hear it. It gets better as it goes and the characters are lovely despite the beginning pains of a fresh crew doing it for the first time.
  - **Extinction Curse**: "Come one, come all! Humble performers become leaders of the Circus of Wayward Wonders when tragedy strikes." **An amazing adventure that is my favorite of their currently finished adventures, I heavily recommend it!** A goofy adventure with lots of fun and **chaos** where the adventurers also try to solve and prevent a serious catastrophe. If you thrive on chaos this might definitely be something for you. I definitely enjoyed it a lot and it gave me some nice distraction during a long hospital visit.
  - **Fists of the Ruby Phoenix**: The "Ruby Phoenix", sorcerer Hao Jin, once again calls for the strongest groups on Golarion to join the biggest martial arts fighting tournament in history. Watch the adventurers progress through the tournament, find their patrons and uncover mysterious happenings during the tournament. Despite being a fighting tournament it still has plenty of social interaction.
  - **Abomination Vaults**: At the time of writing this is the new campaign that they just started, so I can't say too much about it yet, but I love the start and the characterss. Pretty sure I'll heavily enjoy that one a lot again.
- [Dini Mundart](https://www.srf.ch/audio/dini-mundart): A Swiss German podcast by the SRF about dialect and language. I'm enjoying learning more about the language and I gotta admit, it really sounds nice.

## Video Games

- Baldur's Gate 3: What can I say? I'm a sucker for RPG and even more so TTRPG content. And Baldur's Gate perfectly fits my interests. I love the story and the execution with the voice acting. It's a really fun game and you can sink a lot of hours into it and you're probably not gonna see all the choices and possible outcomes.
- Stardew Valley: I spent so many hours tending my farm to relax after stressful days. This game really manages to calm me down.

## Anime/Manga/Webtoon

Years ago the list of Anime/Manga that I would have shared would have been way bigger, but I gave up basically everything for time reasons.

- **[Always Human](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/list?title_no=557)**: This one is a cutesy and relatively short webtoon. It's been a while since I read through it and I should probably reread it again sometime.
- **One Piece**: I like it, but you gotta be aware just how long this one has been going on and how big of a series you're getting yourself into.
