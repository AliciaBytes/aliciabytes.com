# Functionality Test

This post is for me to test out all the features and styling of the website, and to make sure that if I change anything I don't break any of it! This is also a show off for the website where others could check the functionality I implement and how it's implemented on the frontend in the dev tools.

## Embedding Code

I sometimes post code, and I want the syntax to be nicely formatted and the syntax highlighted according to the currently selected theme.

### Without highlighting

```plaintext title="cron"
* * * * * <command to execute>
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─── day of the week (0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday)
│ │ │ └─── month (1 - 12)
│ │ └─── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ └─── hour (0 - 23)
└─── minute (0 - 59)
```

### With syntax highlighting

```rust title="fibonacci.rs"
/// Calculate the `n`th number in the fibonacci sequence recursively.
fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u128 {
        match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        // We start from F₂ here to skip some tiny steps. Meaning that both the
        // previous and current values would be a 1.
        _ => fibonacci_impl(n - 2, 1, 1),
    }
}

/// Inner tail recursive implementation function.
fn fibonacci_impl(n: u32, prev: u128, current: u128) -> u128 {
    if n == 0 {
        current
    } else {
        fibonacci_impl(n - 1, current, prev + current)
    }
}
```

### Inline code

We can also mark up inline code without syntax highlighting `cron` and with syntax highlighting `u64{:rust}`.

## Picture embeds

<PictureFigure src="https://www-cdn.aliciabytes.com/file/aliciabytes-com/pages/about/taking-pictures-at-the-rheinfalls.jpg" alt="A view out through the trees above the Rheinfalls on a nice sunny day. You can see the water flowing rapidly. In the foreground Alicia is holding her phone up in landscape mode to take a picture of the scenery." formats={['avif', 'webp']} fallbackFormat="jpg" width="2000" height="819" quality="mid" caption="A view out through the trees above the Rheinfalls on a nice sunny day. You can see the water flowing rapidly. In the foreground Alicia is holding her phone up in landscape mode to take a picture of the scenery." />

## Spoilers

I want to be able to put things between spoilers and content warnings depending on the situation to actually be considerate of the reader. For example inline spoilers <InlineSpoiler content_note="A very big secret">that certain people are very cute</InlineSpoiler>. Or also big block spoilers:

<Spoiler>
<summary slot="summary">Cuteness</summary>
Actually a lot of people are very very cute!
</Spoiler>

## Showing off recent posts

I can show a listing of my most reacent posts. For example the 3 most recent here:


<CollectionList collection="pages" limit={3} />

## Miscellaneous

There is also miscelaneous items, like the styling of horizontal rulers:

That have to be consistent with the site.@src/components/solid/InlineSpoiler
