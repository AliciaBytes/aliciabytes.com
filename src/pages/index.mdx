# Hi, I'm Alicia

I'm a queer, dorky nerd from Switzerland who loves tech way too much. I work as a software developer and enjoy tinkering around in my free time as well. Taking my own weird way through life with lots of sticks, and stones in the way. But that won't stop me. Life doesn't have to be straightforward, so I'm just taking my own weird way and living it to the fullest now. I'm mostly gonna be writing about my journey through the tech industry and my learnings along the way, but might also write about life in general and private topics every now and then.

I don't explicitly want to have just a list of all my content in chronological order, so I only show the latest [content](/content). It's more supposed to be a map of my thoughts, what I do, things I work with, and especially of how I am. Pages explicitly have other related pages linked at the bottom, as well as pages that link back to them.

Some good **starting points** to get into here are maybe:

- [A guide to my heart (emojis)](/a-guide-to-alicias-heart-emojis/) to learn about my quirky cute organization for heart emojis I have and how I use them to express my feelings.
- [Unashemedly being myself. Everywhere](/unashamedly-being-myself-everywhere/) where I explain why I put so much of myself out there and share it all. Opening up a lot mare than I would have ever dared in the past.
- [Behind the scenes of my website](/colophon/) to see what I use for this website and what some of the goals behind it are.
- ["Lost" years of my past](/lost-years-of-my-past/) if you want to learn way too much about me and my (past) traumas. This page contains a lot of content warnings and content is hidden accordingly by default.
- [Recommendations](/recommendations/) to see what I like and recommend. If you have similar hobbies, like similar things or think I'd like something, feel free to hit me up. ☺️

If you want to follow me, I have a bunch of (social) links down below in the [footer](#footer).
