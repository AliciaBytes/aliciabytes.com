# A Guide to Alicia's heart (emojis)

I'm gonna go and wear my heart on my sleeve here. I'm already always pretty open about myself. And I try to be open about intentions, although one can always do better. But that's not the topic here. The topic is my heart. Well, at least my heart emojis. I'm a very weird and quirky woman. I don't know how common it is for others, but I have a bunch of meanings for the different heart emojis and colors. And why not share that little quirky bit about me?

## General note

While my hearts have specific meanings you gotta be aware that things in life always depend. There will always be exceptions where I use a heart in a different way than I use it in other general cases. Emotions can fluctuate and change, and I won't limit myself to following a reference. This is just a general lay of the land kind of thing what each one means most of the time. Also the meanings of my hearts have shifted quite a bit over the last few years and continue to be in constant motion. I can't guarantee that this guide here will always reflect my newest feelings regarding specific hearts.

### Fixed heart colors

And sometimes I completely disregard my general feelings for a specific heart emoji and use a specific fixed one for a person because I know it's their favorite emoji version or their favorite color or just because I connect that specific heart emoji with them for some other reason. For example each one of my partners also has their individual heart color 💙❤️🖤🩷 that I use for them and the general meaning I use that color for doesn't apply anymore. And even on social media there have been people that "claimed" specific heart colors by now and get those more often simply because it's now a color associated with them 🧡💚🩵🩷💜🖤. Sometimes a single color is associated with multiple people there. Purple for example is an especially popular color it seems, but who can blame them, it's also my favorite color and really amazing!

### Ask if you're curious

I'm pretty open about my feelings, so please if you're curious about my feelings regarding you or what certain hearts I send you mean, just ask. It's no big deal and I'll never react badly to someone asking about my feelings. Completely the opposite, it allows me to state my current feelings and others will not have to doubt the standing anymore and know the level we're at and how to handle without worrying too much or overstepping. It's a win for everyone as far as I'm concerned. That goes from simple comfy vibes, I want to hug you vibes, over squishes and crushes to "just fucking kiss me". I think being open and honest about feelings makes stuff simpler in general. I mean, if they know you feel comfy around them they might also be able to ease up a bit if they were still uncertain about your connection/level of comfort.

## Fancy hearts

Those hearts are really special. I tend to use them a lot for special occasions. I also use them sometimes if I'm feeling good and lucky and really happy in general or something in my life is currently special, but that's not their main use.

- Growing heart 💗: So this one is the ultimate heart for me. I love you a lot and you mean the world to me. I'm falling more and more in love with you. Or my emotions are growing towards you. Sometimes in a just platonic way it's used to show that I'm growing closer to you and feeling the relationship deepen. On very happy days I might even use that one more casually towards people I like or show that I absolutely loved the time together.
- Revolving hearts 💞: Usually they mean I'm sending you lots of love. Lots of support. Wish I could support you, help you, hug you, be there for you right now. I want to send you immediate love to make you feel better. Just I care about you a lot. Not necessarily coupled with love or special feelings, just wanting to send support/love/positivity.
- Beating heart 💓: You're definitely doing something right. I'm excited, enjoying it and loving whatever we have. Again not specifically coupled with special feelings towards you, but things are really positive. *Excited happy heart noises!*
- Two hearts 💕: I use this to show a connection. Most of the time it means that I'm feeling some connection to you. That connection might be of any kind and isn't necessarily simple to specify. I've also started using it when people are really cool and I love their special connection with each other, especially in combination with other hearts then.
- Sparkling heart 💖: To show that something special, sparkling. Quite often used with other hearts to add some specialness on top of them.
- Heart exclamation ❣️: Almost exclusively used in combination with other hearts and it's to show that the magnitude of the other hearts is really big and should be considered amplified. You've caused a big heart reaction from me.

## Colored hearts

Those are the main hearts that show different feelings and levels of emotions. I use them a lot. I love to show hearts and send them to people. I'm just very open with my hearts. And even if they might mean quite a bit, it might not be a reason to overthink right away.

- Purple heart 💜: Purple is my favorite color. I love this a lot. And maybe I want to get there with you too? Just maybe. I usually use this for people I'm really close too and people I really like, or am crushing on. Also for special occasions or sending really a lot of support.
- Green heart 💚: Green is the color of hope. I usually use this one to send and show support. When I want to be there for others. But it also gets used for good friends or people I'd like to get to know more and maybe become good friends with. Definitely into your vibe! :3
- Light blue heart 🩵: This heart has been one of the new but then heavily being used additions. It's for ultra comfy wholesome feeling good adorable vibes where I'm completely at ease and comfortable and love the conversation or situation. It fills a big need to show that kind of feeling and I can't believe how much I'm using it now.
- Blue heart 💙: People I'm not really close with. Someone I'd love to hang out and become more of a friend with. Not as strong as the green one, but still I like your vibe and maybe we can do something together.
- Orange heart 🧡: Casual friends/acquaintances. You're a good bean and I like you, but probably I don't know you enough yet to up you further? Or something else maybe I guess?
- Yellow heart 💛:  Highly situation dependent. I might use it for various reasons not listed here. But often it's just a casual heart. An "I don't know you, but I like this" heart.
- Pink heart 🩷: Soft vulnerable feelings. But also often a softer/lighter version of 🩵 with comfy wholesome feelings. Can also be used to show that I'm comfortable opening up about vulnerable things with you. Quite a bit used in conjunction with 🩷🩵 for that soft vulnerable adorable comfy wholesome feeling.
- Black heart 🖤: The "Enigma heart". I use it for situations where I don't know exactly. Or it might be that you are an enigma to me at the moment still. Maybe I don't know how I feel about things. Or I'm feeling a bit dark right now in general. It's often just an unknown random enigma heart and I often don't know the reason why I use it myself.
- White heart 🤍: It's a blank heart. For when I can't decide what heart to use. Don't interpret too much into it, it could be used for all kinds of reasons. Sorry to not be able to tell you more about it or my feelings when using it. Chances are there's not really any deeper meaning behind it!
- Gray heart 🩶: I don't use this one often at all? I don't know what to tell you. It's not in my standard use and there's probably some meaning? Maybe? I don't know? Chances are you won't see this one (a lot).

## Combining hearts

I've started combining hearts to show even more feelings. But I'm at a point where it's still a bit chaotic. Unicode feelings encoding standard when??? 🥺👉👈 It can show a combination of multiple of the reactions like 🩵💚 to show that "Hey, you give me ultra comfy wholesome adorable feelings, I like you. And I want to send you support (and probably hugs)." In other cases it could be 🧡💙 to mean that it's transitioning from  just considering you a good bean that I like to someone I really want to hang out with. Other hearts like 💖 & ❣️ are mostly used to emphasize the other hearts and their emotions. 🖤💜 is also one of my favorite that has currently sadly way too many different meanings. I need to work on this. As a general rule just think about what the individual hearts mean and try to fit some combination of meanings together that works. That's what I do quite often until I get proper way to show more feelings with them. Otherwise because the combined ones definitely makes my feelings harder to know, as always, feel free to ask me.

## Thoughts for the end

I just wanna say that this is kind of nice to share. Being open about emotions or how I sometimes share them with others. Again, don't take this as a strict reference sheet, emotions are weird and quirky. And I'm already quirky enough without focusing on emotions specifically. I'm a bit curious now though if anyone else has special meanings behind their hearts? Or do you have one favorite heart color that you tend to use for almost anything? Really all hearts and emotions are valid and special, but it would be interesting to know how people tick there.
