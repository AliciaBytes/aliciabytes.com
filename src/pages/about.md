# Hi, I'm Alicia.

I'm a queer, dorky nerd from Germany who loves tech way too much and enjoys tinkering around in her free time. Taking my own weird way through life with lots of sticks, and stones in the way. But that won't stop me. Life doesn't have to be straightforward, so I'm just taking my own weird way and living it to the fullest now. Maybe I can even make life better for others.

Some of my interests are:

- Tech: I love tinkering with anything techy. I'm a soft girl though, so usually I mostly deal with software and not as much with hardware.
- TTRPGs: I love playing but also listening to podcasts or getting into the lore of the worlds.
- Video games: Mostly roleplaying games, relaxing comfy games, space games or turn based strategy games. Also up for group based fun.
- Board games: Getting more and more into it again after not playing a lot of board games for a few years.

For more interests have a look at some [content that I enjoy and recommend](/things-i-enjoy-and-recommend/).

If you want to know way too much about my past you can read ["Lost" years of my past](/lost-years-of-my-past) I guess. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But be warned, that page has quite a few content warnings.
