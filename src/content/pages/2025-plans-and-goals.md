The last few years have been pretty busy and hectic for me. Especially with running from one thing to the next, lots of plan changes and also way too much travelling. I'm trying to have things a bit more structured this year and also to focus a bit more on myself and time for recovery.

## Get settled and comfortable

Being more comfortable and far less traveling in general. I traveled so much between countries, and also between my place and my partners places the last view years that at points it felt like I was away far more than I was at home. And that was really exhausting and cutting into my time to actually do things myself. So the plan is to make this a comfy year and take time for myself. I still want to meet and visit people, but maybe invite people over more instead for now until I recovered a bit from all the traveling... And we got a guest room going forward too, which thankfully should make that easier. Although to be honest that plan is off to a bad start with a new GF who is living abroad and a big Australia vacation planned. But I'll at least try it.

## Being more selfish

I feel like I focused a lot on putting myself out there, connecting, making myself available. And that ranges from meeting people I only knew online, but wanted to get to know, all the way to partners where I feel like I came to visit them way more than they came over. That added to the amount I was out, that I couldn't be relaxing at home with my things, not necessarily being able to do the things I wanted to do. It was a big point of exhaustion for myself. So this year I want to be a bit more selfish. Stay at home more. Make people come over to my place more instead of going to visit them. Take the time that I need to do my things instead of making myself available to do things with others. Be that relaxing alone time at home, reading a book, listening to podcast, playing my own games, or some coding projects. Just things I want to do without necessarily thinking how I can make others happy. I kinda hate it, because I don't want to be selfish. In general I'm a person who thrives on making others happy, so doing things together is amazing. But I also feel like I overdid it and have to take more time for myself. No matter how much I thrive on doing things together and making others happy, there is a limit before I overexert myself.

## Giving a lot of love to this website

I have a lot of plans for changes with my website. It will probably have to wait until after my big Australia vacation though before I can really start it. I also sadly changed my plans with the kinky NSFW section for my website due to ToS restrictions with services and platforms I use. ðŸ˜“ But I have a whole lot of other plans still. My website sadly is one project that always gets neglected a bit and I want to change this. Having more time at home will hopefully help a lot here.

## Cooking and Baking

I want to bake and cook more. I have talked with my partners and want to try way more new recipies instead of just making the tried and true. With a small goal of making our own little private cookbook with all the things we really like. It's gonna be fun. I love cooking, it calms me down and is a nice counter to my time at the desk for work and private nerdery. And I especially love being able to cook for others. ðŸ¥°ðŸ’—

## Streaming

I already had that as a plan last year. I want to actually commit to streaming more this year. It didn't work out too well in 2024, but I know the reasons for it. The year was generally way too busy and I didn't have that  much time for streaming. Then I'm also mostly comfy mode at home (meaning wearing [almost] nothing) and having to dress for stream is annoying, so I'm gonna have more streams without camera in the future, or with a simple vtube avatar. Then we have the issue that the current apartment just gets wayyy too hot and I'm just melting (especially if I have to wear sth.). But seriously, we're in the top floor and it just heats the hell up. In the summer it's just melting weather where you don't want to wear anything or have the PC running and producing more heat. Additionally I always have to carry up the room divider or get it out from behind the standing mirror as a barrier, so that people can't see certain parts of our apartment which is kind of a pain to do every time. Streaming without camera and having a new better set-up with the new apartment is gonna help a lot with things.

## Explore Switzerland

I actually travelled way way more abroad than within Switzerland last year and I want to explore here too. It's my new home. It's where I love together with my partner, enjoying life together. It feels nice and comfortable here and I really want to make an effort to get settled and also know a bit about the country, meet people and make friends. It's easy to become lonely when moving far away, and I've been a pretty retreated, shy and lonesome person in the past anyways. So I want to make sure this doesn't happen here. Travelling should also help with meeting people, having things to talk, and making friends. I already made some friends, but most of my connections here are still through my partner's friendship circles and I need my own circle for it to be completely healthy relationships. Although this will maybe happen later in the year as I'm still exhausted from traveling.

## Kink and NSFW content

More kinky time, more photo shoots and just generally having fun with my kinky, lewd side. That's as much as I'm gonna say here on my website, but I want to explore my kinky, lewd side even further in the future.

## Other plans and goals

There are some more private resolutions too I guess... But I think that's the main ones I can mention publicly? The others also sometimes have to do with insecurites, disorders and mental health where I'm not sure I feel comfortable saying all of that online, despite generally being very open about things.
