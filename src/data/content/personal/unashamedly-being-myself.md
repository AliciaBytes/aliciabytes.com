I need to let out my feelings and talk about what it means to be unashamedly myself. What it means to myself. Why I want to do it and it's important to me. What my fears about it and some negative consequences are. But also the positive consequences for me (and hopefully also others around me).

It's been on my mind for a while already, but especially after this past weekend and the (2024) European election results. (As I'm typing this, not as of this blog post releasing. This will probably be quite a while in the past by the time you get to see it.) I got asked if I'm not worried about putting my [Trauma](/lost-years-of-my-past/) publicly. If I'm not afraid about employers seeing it and me not getting work. But also about being public with it in general and just having other people know so much about me, people I might not even know anything at all about.

The thing is it's part of my life. It's a fucked up shitty part of my life that I also wish went quite a lot differently, but that can't be changed now and there's no reason even fantasizing about it. It's a part of me and also part of what made me **ME**. For better or worse. I am who I am and a lot of that is also through my experiences and surroundings. If I don't get a job because of it, then so be it. It might not have been something for me anyways. The thing is, I don't want to be at a place where I later find out that it's very hostile towards minorities or people that don't fit their pristine perfect schema. If they self select out that's okay. I might lose out on jobs, promotions or better pay, but I'd rather have a friendly welcoming place where I can be comfortable and safely be myself anyways. In the end being myself is more important than money to me.

## I don't care much or at all what others think about me anymore

I cared too much in the past about fitting in and being the perfect son/student/person everyone expected me to be and it was fucking awful. Always feeling like a failure for not living up to stupid expectations and having to try and hiding and masking who I actually am. So I just don't care anymore and just allow myself to be absolutely authentically myself. We all should be able to live our life the way we are. Just authentically us. Life is just so much better and happier when you're just being yourself. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥°ðŸ’š There are still some filters, but very very few.

Honestly, it's just nice living as yourself and just letting all the pressure and weight of social expectations fall off from your heart.

The remaining filters are also for the most part not really about me caring about what others think about me, but rather about respect, boundaries and consent. For example I avoid any kind of swearing in front of children to not give them a bad example. Also no kink in public, and only with content warning/note online, so people know before clicking.

## Even at work I don't keep it a secret, even though I don't shout it out either

For the record, that's a thing where my current employer is really good. I don't have to worry about it one bit. They asked about my big ass gap in my CV (like they all do) and yeah, it's due to my mental health and trauma and just shitty past that I also wish went differently, but is how it is and is now part of me. And I told them that I have a [page about why and what was going on with me during that time on my website](/lost-years-of-my-past/). It wasn't anything that's come up since. Now at work I have my dedicated desk with a little standy picture frame. It's currently holding a picture of me and my 3 partners at our first ever vacation together. And on the top left corner of the picture frame I have a little button heart attached that says "Fucking Weirdo". My girlfriend got me that one at a local Con. Most people don't even worry about the picture or ask anything, so I'm not aware if they know that those are my partners. I don't hide it but also don't immediately shout "Look, those are my partners". But if it comes up I'll tell them. Like one colleague asked me about the luggage I took to work on Fridays a few times and I told him I'm going to my other partners over the weekend, straight from work. And then we also talked about the picture at my desk. No big deal. Some people are aware I'm polyamorous with multiple partners, I think almost all are aware that I'm trans. People at least know that I'm living together with my girlfriend so they'd think I'm lesbian? Or they're aware that I have girlfriends and boyfriends and am actually bi/pan. Depending on who it is. LIke I said, I don't hide it but I also don't tell everyone as soon as I see them what specific status I am, so people that don't know just might have different assumptions. Also it's interesting how people get confused when you talk about your GF or BF or Partner and you have multiple and they're like "Wait I thought your partner was/did that?" and you switched to talking about the other partner in the meantime and they just didn't know or catch onto it. I'm keeping it completely anonymous regarding my partners though, I don't want to publically share too much about them, so I always limit it to mentioning GF, BF or Partner and not saying names or distinguishing further. Also it's just amazing for me to be able to look at a picture of all my loved ones when I'm stuck in the office for a long work day.

## Showing off a lot of queer affection

I'm also a person who loves to show affection. Like a lot lot. Be weird, quirky, hella queer and affectionate. To be fair, I scale it to the comfort levels of my partners though since I get the feeling I'm the most publicly affectionate one sometimes. But snuggling, holding hands, nibbling, biting. It gives me life and makes me feel loved. Let others see, I don't care. Affection and love is something nice and shouldn't be hidden.

## It's also a bit of a statement

We live in times where in quite a few areas around the world populist, right wing and fascist parties are gaining a lot of votes. As can be seen in this years European election. Where hate is sadly on the up a lot for a few years already. Places can feel way less safe. All that hatred can be scary and depressing, making one want to hide and be invisible. But I want to provide some counterbalance to that, just be me. Weird, quirky and queer. Show that this is normal and amazing and we can all be ourselves. Fuck all the hate against us, we'll get through this together. We need more visibility and support. We need to make it safer for everyone to be themselves. But understandably a lot of people still have to hide their identity and be invisible. That's why us who can be visible, who feel confident enough to, should be visible for them too. And to be honest, I also sometimes feel weird or scared depending on my emotional state and where I am (and especially if parts of my trauma get triggered), so I understand it. And that's why I don't want to hide, why I want to be highly public about it and show it, because I can (ultimately without too much of an influence to my life). And I know I'm priviledged for that. And very thankful for it and don't take it for granted. I also want to improve the situation for others too, although I'm not doing much yet, but I want to do more in the future.

And yeah, like I said, I'm still anxious about it and sometimes scared. Mostly because of past trauma, but also I have generalized anxiety disorder and get anxiety attacks for so many different things. Losing and not being able to get a job because of wanting to be truly myself and out about it, just living myself is one more point that can cause anxiety. Especially because having a job here is currently a requirement for my residence permit and also that I wouldn't last long on savings at all.
