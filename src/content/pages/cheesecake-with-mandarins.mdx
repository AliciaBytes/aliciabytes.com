Time to share a recipe for a cheesecake with mandarins, one of my favorite cakes growing up. I still love it a lot and it's easy to make as well as very tasty ðŸ˜‹

## Ingredients

### For the dough

- 200 g flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 75 g sugar
- 1 pack vanilla sugar
- 1 egg
- 100g butter

### For the filling

- 500 g low-fat quark
- 150-175 g sugar
- 100 g crÃ¨me fraÃ®che / sour cream
- 75 ml oil
- 1 pack vanilla pudding powder
- 200 ml milk
- 2 eggs
- 1 can of mandarins
- Clear cake glazing (Optional, I usually leave it off)

## Baking Utensils

- 26 cm spring form

## Instructions

1. Mix all the ingredients for the dough into a bowl and knead them thoroughly. Cover the dough bowl and put it into the fridge for half an hour.
2. Put baking paper into the spring form to cover the bottom and cover the walls with butter.
3. Prepare the cheesecake filling. Mix 500g low-fat quark, 100 g crÃ¨me fraÃ®che / sour cream, 150-175 g sugar and 75 ml oil in a bowl. Then slowly mix in the 200 ml milk, and pudding powder, as well as the 2 eggs.
4. Separate the Mandarins and their juice. Keep the juice for the clear cake glazing if you want to make some.
5. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C.
6. Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it out. Then cover out the cake form, trying to make it even thickness everywhere. Make sure to form a bit of a crust to hold the cheesecake filling. It should only be a few centimeters high. Poke some holes into the floor of the cake with a fork.
7. Put the filling within the cake and gently spread the mandarins on it, so that they float at the top.
8. Bake the cake for 50 minutes at 180Â°C. Afterwards let it cool down in the slightly opened oven.
9. (Optional) If you want to go with the cake glazing you should prepare it according to it's instructions, but replace some of the water required with the juice from the mandarins to give it more of a mandarin taste. Cover the top of the cake with the glazing.
10. Let the cake cool down before eating. You can just let it cool down at room temperature, but I prefer to put it into the fridge, as I love the taste of it when it's quite chill.

Also here are some pictures of the cake:
