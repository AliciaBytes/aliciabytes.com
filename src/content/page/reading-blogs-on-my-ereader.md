My E-Reader is probably one of the nicest quality of life improvements to every day that I got from tech recently. I just really enjoy it. I'm still not reading as much again as I used to in the past, but it brought me a bunch of improvements already. Some of the more general ones are:

- I don't have to carry around a bunch of heavy books. Especially because I switch between books usually and would love to have a fiction as well as a non-fiction book along at most times.
- It feels way easier on the eyes to read compared to a monitor or regular phone/tablet screen (which I tried for a brief moment but gave up again really fast).
- The brightness is way more configurable, especially on the low end, compared to my phone. So it doesn't blind me if I lay in bed at night reading late.
- For some reason that I don't know, reading on the E-Reader makes me feel less dizzy/sick when I move (on the train) while reading.
- Amazing battery life comparably so I can read worry-free.

## Reading blog posts on my E-Reader

A big advantage is also being able to read blog posts on my E-Reader. Sadly, there are a whole bunch of websites out there that are simply annoying and unfriendly to many users, including me. For example because of too low contrast making it hard to read, animations that are too much, too many ads that make it borderline unusable, etc.

Thankfully, the [Kobo Libra 2](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2) E-Reader that I use has an integration with [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/). So any link that I save to Pocket will automatically be converted into an E-Reader friendly format and get synchronized onto the E-Reader at night when I sleep. That means no ads and also full control over the font, color, brightness, etc. for readability that I'm used to with E-Books. And websites that I finished and archived on my E-Reader also get archived in Pocket. I can do that synchronization manually, but I barely ever do that.

Here's an example of how this article for example looks like on my E-Reader:

That also means though that I don't read articles as soon as they come out. I usually end up reading stuff the weekend after, so I'm a bit behind on the "hype", that might arguably be a good thing though.

## E-Books and managing them

For actual E-Books I'm using Calibre to manage my collection, which has grown quite a lot over the years. I try to get my E-Books as DRM-free as possible, although that's sadly not always an option. And there are a bunch of libraries that can give you access to E-Books, although I don't ave that option right now.

I usually try to keep the amount of books I actually have loaded onto my E-Reader as minimal as possible, and keep a log of what books I still want to read or already have read outside of it in my usual note-taking application. I also usually have a small handy erasable notebook for taking quick notes about the book I'm reading and later at some point I'll transfer that over to a digital note.

One issue I'm having is that a lot of stuff I read is still only available in PDF format that's fixed size and doesn't reflow, and this doesn't work particularly well on the E-Reader since it's usually meant for a bigger form factor and looks too small. For example, my Pathfinder PDFs are usually like this.
